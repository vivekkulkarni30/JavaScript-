// In JavaScript, variables are declared using one of three keywords,
// ie. var, const and let.

const email = "vivek@gmail.com"
let age = 21;
var city = "pune";

favHobby = "listening music"; // this is alsom the way to declare the varaiable.

 /* prefer not to use var, 
 because of issue in block scope and functional-scope */

 // note - if you want to print all the above data in a table the, we can use 

 console.table([email, age, city, favHobby]);
